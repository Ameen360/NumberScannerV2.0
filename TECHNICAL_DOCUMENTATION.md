# Technical Documentation: AI-Powered Automated Car Plate Number Recognition System

## System Architecture

The license plate recognition system is designed with a modular architecture consisting of two primary components:

1. **Color Classification Module**
2. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Module**

These components are integrated into a unified system that processes license plate images to extract both the plate number and identify the plate type based on its background color.

## Color Classification Module

### Overview

The color classification module identifies the type of license plate based on its background color:
- Green: Government vehicles
- Blue: Private vehicles
- Red: Commercial vehicles

### Implementation Details

#### HSV Color Space

The module converts input images from BGR to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, which is more robust for color-based segmentation than RGB. In HSV:
- Hue represents the color type
- Saturation represents the vibrancy of the color
- Value represents the brightness

#### Color Range Definition

Predefined HSV color ranges for each plate type:
```python
self.green_range = (np.array([35, 50, 50]), np.array([85, 255, 255]))  # Government
self.blue_range = (np.array([90, 50, 50]), np.array([130, 255, 255]))  # Private
self.red_range1 = (np.array([0, 50, 50]), np.array([10, 255, 255]))    # Commercial (lower red)
self.red_range2 = (np.array([170, 50, 50]), np.array([180, 255, 255])) # Commercial (upper red)
```

Note: Red is defined in two ranges because the hue value in HSV wraps around (0° and 360° both represent red).

#### Classification Algorithm

1. Convert the image to HSV color space
2. Apply slight Gaussian blur to reduce noise
3. Create binary masks for each color range using `cv2.inRange()`
4. Count non-zero pixels in each mask to determine color coverage
5. Calculate the percentage of each color relative to the total image size
6. Identify the dominant color based on the highest percentage
7. Return the plate type and confidence score

### Performance Considerations

- The color classification is highly accurate (100%) for clean, synthetic images
- Real-world performance may vary due to:
  - Lighting conditions
  - Faded or damaged plates
  - Camera quality and settings
  - Reflections and shadows

## OCR Module

### Overview

The OCR module extracts alphanumeric text from license plate images using Tesseract OCR with custom preprocessing.

### Implementation Details

#### Preprocessing Pipeline

1. Convert the image to grayscale
2. Apply bilateral filtering to reduce noise while preserving edges
3. Apply adaptive thresholding to create a binary image with better local contrast

```python
# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply bilateral filter to preserve edges while reducing noise
gray = cv2.bilateralFilter(gray, 11, 17, 17)

# Apply adaptive thresholding
thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(gray, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, 
                              cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
```

#### Tesseract OCR Configuration

The module uses Tesseract OCR with the following configuration:
- PSM 7 (Treat the image as a single line of text)
- Character whitelist (optional, can be added for better accuracy)

```python
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(processed_img, config='--psm 7')
```

#### Post-processing

After OCR extraction, the text is cleaned to remove non-alphanumeric characters:

```python
text = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isalnum())
```

### Performance Considerations

- Current OCR accuracy is limited (~5.75% character-level accuracy)
- Performance can be improved by:
  - Fine-tuning preprocessing parameters
  - Using a custom-trained OCR model for license plates
  - Implementing character segmentation before OCR
  - Adding character-specific post-processing rules

## Integrated System

### Overview

The integrated system combines both modules to provide a complete solution for license plate recognition.

### Implementation Details

#### Processing Pipeline

1. Input: License plate image
2. Extract text using the OCR module
3. Classify plate type using the Color Classification module
4. Return combined results with confidence scores
5. (Optional) Visualize results on the input image

#### Visualization

The system provides visualization capabilities to display:
- Extracted plate number
- Identified plate type with confidence score
- Ground truth data (during evaluation)

### Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the system
system = PlateRecognitionSystem()

# Process a license plate image
image = cv2.imread('license_plate.jpg')
results = system.process_plate(image)

# Print results
print(f"Plate Number: {results['plate_number']}")
print(f"Plate Type: {results['plate_type']} ({results['confidence']:.1f}%)")

# Visualize results
vis_image, _ = system.visualize_results(image, 'output.jpg')
```

## Evaluation Framework

### Overview

The evaluation framework assesses the system's performance on both color classification and OCR tasks.

### Implementation Details

#### Ground Truth Data

The system uses a JSON file containing ground truth data for each image:
- Plate text
- Plate category (green/blue/red)

#### Metrics

1. **Color Classification Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score per class
   - Confusion matrix

2. **OCR Performance Metrics**:
   - Character-level accuracy
   - Sample comparisons of true vs. predicted text

#### Visualization

The evaluation framework generates:
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Detailed evaluation report
- Sample images with both predictions and ground truth

### Current Performance

- Color Classification: 100% accuracy
- OCR: ~5.75% character-level accuracy

## Dataset

### Overview

The system uses synthetic license plate images generated with controlled parameters:
- 50 images per plate type (green, blue, red)
- 20% of images reserved for testing
- Consistent plate number patterns (ABC123, XYZ789, etc.)

### Generation Process

1. Create blank plates with specified background colors
2. Add random noise to simulate real-world variations
3. Add plate number text with consistent font and positioning
4. Split into training and testing sets

### Limitations
